# cat-food-tracker
This App was built to track the times when our cats were fed. 
Cat names are hardcoded and text is in German, I did plan on making it customizable in the future.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
